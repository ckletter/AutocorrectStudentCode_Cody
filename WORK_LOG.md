| April 5  |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                      I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| March 12 | 2:30-2:53pm | I spent this time writing the tabulation edit distance based off the lecture in class. I wasn't sure where we should find threshold so I made it an instance variable in the autocorrect class. |
| March 14 | 12:35-1:05  |                                                                                I spent this time properly sorting the edit distances by alphabetical and then by edit distance and tested them. |
| March 16 | 4:50-5:20pm |                                               I spent this time thinking about how to find "candidates" using 2 grams and 3 grams, specifically an array of array lists to find similar tokens. |
