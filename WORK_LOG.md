| April 5  |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| March 12 | 2:30-2:53pm |                                                                                                                                        I spent this time writing the tabulation edit distance based off the lecture in class. I wasn't sure where we should find threshold so I made it an instance variable in the autocorrect class. |
| March 14 | 12:35-1:05  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I spent this time properly sorting the edit distances by alphabetical and then by edit distance and tested them. |
| March 16 | 4:50-5:20pm |                                                                                                                        I spent this time thinking about how to find "candidates" using 2 grams and 3 grams, specifically an array of array lists to find similar tokens. I also created a function that finds n-grams of a given word. |
| Mar 18   | 10:55-11:55 |                                                                              I spent this time talking with Mr. Blick about both an approach with tokenization and an approach with a Trie using DFS and pruning with edit distance. For the last 10 minutes of class, I began coding the TST to store all the words in my dictionary. |
| Mar 20   |  8:55-9:55  |                                                                                    I spent this time implementing the trie that I discussed with Mr. Blick in class to calculate lev. distance while following DFS. I thought about using the same method with different parameters to replicate addition, substitution, and deletion. |
| Mar 21   |  2:00-3:00  |                                                                                                                                                                                                        I spent this time continuing to write my DFS method after speaking with Mr. Blick. I decided to focus on which "state" I am in. |
| Mar 25   |  8:15-8:45  |                                                                                                                                             I spent this time adding a letter map and fixing some bugs, and revising my depth first search method. I decided I needed one more path to follow for when there has been no "edits" made. |
| Mar 25   |  8:45-9:15  | Continued making modifications in DFS including removing my follow rest of word method (I decided that method was already handled by the different states of DFS), and therefore creating another base case for if the current word exists or not. I still am running into errors with substitution and lining up my indices correctly |
| Mar 27   | 9:30-10:15  |                                                                   Huge progress! I changed my array list from adding strings to adding word objects so that I can also sort by edit distance. I am now noticing that it is finding the correct number of words! But the edit distance is off... I am now working on fixing this error. |
