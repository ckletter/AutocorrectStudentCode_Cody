| April 5  |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| March 12 | 2:30-2:53pm |                                                           I spent this time writing the tabulation edit distance based off the lecture in class. I wasn't sure where we should find threshold so I made it an instance variable in the autocorrect class. |
| March 14 | 12:35-1:05  |                                                                                                                                          I spent this time properly sorting the edit distances by alphabetical and then by edit distance and tested them. |
| March 16 | 4:50-5:20pm |                                           I spent this time thinking about how to find "candidates" using 2 grams and 3 grams, specifically an array of array lists to find similar tokens. I also created a function that finds n-grams of a given word. |
| Mar 18   | 10:55-11:55 | I spent this time talking with Mr. Blick about both an approach with tokenization and an approach with a Trie using DFS and pruning with edit distance. For the last 10 minutes of class, I began coding the TST to store all the words in my dictionary. |
| Mar 20   |  8:55-9:55  |       I spent this time implementing the trie that I discussed with Mr. Blick in class to calculate lev. distance while following DFS. I thought about using the same method with different parameters to replicate addition, substitution, and deletion. |
| Mar 21   |  2:00-3:00  |                                                                                                                           I spent this time continuing to write my DFS method after speaking with Mr. Blick. I decided to focus on which "state" I am in. |
